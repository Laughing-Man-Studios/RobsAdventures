# Robs Adventures
This is a small web app for tracking my status on my various hikes. The front end will display a google maps widget with all of my location waypoints as well as blog messages and photos from my trips. The backend will handle getting my location data from my email account as well as my blog messages and storing them in a database. 

My current trips tracked on this page are:

- John Muir Trail
